# Simulations for various Matroid secretary algorithms

The following project consists of simulations for various secretary and Matroid secretary algorithms found in literature. 
This is meant to be a framework for testing and exploring further research ideas in this area. Currently, two files are 
up and working.

1) The classic secretary algorithm in secretary.cpp

2) The classic secretary algorithm with stochastic arrivals and departures, as described in the paper "How to Hire Secretaries 
with Stochastic Departures" by Thomas Kesselheim, Alexandros Psomas, Shai Vardi [[arXiV:1909.08660](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08660)]
